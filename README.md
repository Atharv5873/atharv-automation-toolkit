# Atharv Automation Toolkit

Welcome to **Atharv Automation Toolkit** â€” my personal collection of **custom Bash scripts** built to automate and simplify everyday **Linux system administration** and **DevOps** tasks.

This is a **continuous project** where I keep adding scripts that I personally use to speed up my workflow, manage servers, and explore system automation.

---

## About

Each script in this repository is designed with:
- âœ… Safe and reliable Bash practices (`set -euo pipefail`)
- ðŸŽ¨ Clean, color-coded output
- ðŸ§© Modular functions and easy readability
- ðŸ’¬ Inline comments and documentation

Whether itâ€™s restarting a service safely, monitoring resource usage, or automating configuration â€” every script is built from real-world use.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atharv-sharma/atharv-automation-toolkit.git
cd atharv-automation-toolkit
```

If you plan to use these scripts frequently, you can **add the toolkit directory to your system PATH** so you can run the tools from anywhere in your terminal.
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/atharv-automation-toolkit/system"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
Now you can run your scripts globally like:
```
reaload-ssh.sh
```

## ðŸ§  Personal Aliases

This toolkit also includes a set of **custom Bash aliases** I use for faster system administration.

To use them:
```bash
source ~/atharv-automation-toolkit/aliases/personal_aliases.sh
```
